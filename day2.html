    <h3>Hoisting</h3>
    <p>Hoisting is a default Javascript Mechanism where our variables and Functions declarations are moved to top of their Scope before code execution (),only declarations are hoisted not initializations.</p>
  <h3>Temporal Dead Zone</h3>
  <p>The time between the Variables hosted and the variables get initialized is called the Temporal Dead Zone
    Let and const are also hoisted and are in Temporal Dead Zone</p>
